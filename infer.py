Aside from just this, I'ts also a good idea to take note of how mush energy your buster has. I know you said that it wouldn't let you choose your buster parts, but I remember them equipping you with a unit pack alpha, where you got 2 attack, 2 enregy, 2 range, and 1 rapid,
right? Anyway, count the number of shots your energy gives you. If you have no equips given, you will have 3 red shots. If not, 5 green shots. After you shoot your max shots, STOP!
and run backwards. This will solve your problem of moving too close, because not only will you be moving less and shooting faster, you can also run back when not fireing, rather than keep moving forward.

Hope this all helps!(or makes sense ^^;)""",
        """Then nothing is wrong: that's how it works. Maybe it's the only flaw of that trick. To make things simpler for you do this: Once you find an enemy, Hold both B2 (lock on) and Square (shoot), and keep tapping the UP button like mad. So only your left thumb would be hurting at the end of the day instead of both :D
